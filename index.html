                        A14 Bionic, the fastest chip in a smartphone.
                        An edge-to-edge OLED display. Ceramic Shield with four times better drop performance. And Night mode on every camera.
                        iPhone 12 has it all — in two perfect sizes.
                        A14 Bionic is the first 5-nanometre chip in the industry, with advanced components literally atoms wide. 
                        Forty per cent more transistors rev up speeds while increasing efficiency for great battery life. And a new ISP 
                        powers Dolby Vision recording — something no pro movie camera, let alone any other phone, can do.
                        The LiDAR Scanner on iPhone 12 Pro measures how long it takes light to reflect back from objects, so it can create 
                        a depth map of any space you’re in. Because it’s ultrafast and accurate, 
                        AR apps can now transform a room into a realistic rainforest or show you exactly how a new sneaker will fit.
